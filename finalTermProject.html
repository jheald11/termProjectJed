        <h1>Jed's Next Five Years and Beyond</h1>

        <p>Here's a link to my favorite soccer team, <a href="https://www.chelseafc.com/en">Chelsea</a href></p>
         
        <p>I want my college experience to be all that it is hyped up to be. 
          I want to have some of the most fun I'll ever have and meet students, 
          professors and coaches who become some of the most important people in my life
          down the road. I want to accel academically, athletically and socially. 

        </p>
        <p>I intend to major in some sort of business degree or ecnomics and am thinking 
          about at minor or major in studio art at the moment. I don't know where these will take me after
          college, but I am beyond excited to find out. I have a brother that works in venture capital 
          in New York City, and I see that as something I could get into but I haven't made up my mind at 
          all in terms of a career.
        </p>
        <p>I have a strong interest in travelling and some day want to become an artist or a 
          creator, whether that is with physical art or filming or what not I am not sure. I am always watching
          videos online on Youtube and am inspired by so many who get to travel as a living and 
          document their life through the lens of a camera. </p>
        <p> Four of my next five years will be here at W&L and I am very excited for the opportunities 
          ahead. I want to learn and try new things as much as I can. I am pumped about our men's lacrosse team
          and look forward to seeing where our success can take us.
        </p>
        <p>One of my favorite piano videos is Brett Kavanaugh playing in front of viewrs in London.
          I have begun learning how to play the piano and see myself improving immensely over the next five years.
