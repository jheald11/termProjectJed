    <h3>The answers to your questions</h3>

           2) DOCTYPE html, html lang="en", title, meta charset, name and content, head, body, 
              header, img, p-paragraph
           3) /title, /head, /h1, /p, /h2, /body, /html. The closing tag tells the program that you are 
              done with that particular section of text. For example, you use a header closing tag because
              you only want certain words to be in the header and other words to be in the paragraph below.
           4) The opening and closing tags for a comment are <! -- and -- > (spaced out so it doesn't register 
           in the program and end the current comment)
           5) The name of the attribute property is img src, and my image was in the downloads folder
           6) The img src stands for image source, used to find the source of the image.
           7) The image source (img src) tag is used to locate an image on your computer and place it into
              the html webpage
           8) The title tag is in the head 
           9) The headings are numbered differently to imply paragraph breaks and font changes
           10) Paragraph tags are NOT numbered at all
           11) Lorem ipsum text is placeholder content to mimic the spacing of real words.-->
